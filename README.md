This repository contains the practical test for course MLA202, implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The main file is a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates reinforcement learning algorithms and their results.

Steps to run the project:

1.Download or clone the repository from GitHub and extract it to a local folder.

2.Ensure that Python is installed on your system. Python 3 is recommended.

3.Install the required Python packages. If any packages such as numpy, gym/gymnasium, matplotlib, or torch are missing, install them using pip.

4.Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

5.Start Jupyter Notebook by running:

jupyter notebook


6.Open the file 03240399_practical_test.ipynb from the Jupyter interface.

7.Run the notebook cells in order to execute the programs and generate the results.

The output graphs and results will be displayed within the notebook and are also saved as image files in the repository.
